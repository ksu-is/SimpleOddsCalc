# Project Roadmap

## Sprint 1
- [x] Find related respository
    - https://github.com/ktseng/holdem_calc
- [x] Evaluate and run related program
    - Parts of holdem_calc  can be used, however due to errors in the code the program will not run. Will still examine the peices identified as useful for reconstructing in this program
    - Useful areas of holdem_calc are the detecting named hands, user input, and evaluation of user input
    - May also want to add a GUI after program is functional. The calculator program we created will be useful for that
    - A lot of the programs found through github have issues, so remember not to be that guy who poorly documents and makes it hard for others to run your code
- [x] Find a readme example to use
    - Basic Structure is there, however continue to evaluate and add as needed
- [x] Update Readme file
