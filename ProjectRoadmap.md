# Project Roadmap

## Sprint 1
- [x] Find related respository
    - https://github.com/ktseng/holdem_calc
- [x] Evaluate and run related program
    - Parts of holdem_calc  can be used, however due to errors in the code the program will not run. Will still examine the pieces identified as useful for reconstructing in this program
    - Useful areas of holdem_calc are the detecting named hands, user input, and evaluation of user input
    - May also want to add a GUI after program is functional. The calculator program we created will be useful for that
    - A lot of the programs found through github have issues, so remember not to be that guy who poorly documents and makes it hard for others to run your code
- [x] Find a readme example to use
    - Basic Structure is there, however continue to evaluate and add as needed
- [x] Update Readme file

## Sprint 2
- [x] Get basic layout completed
    - [x] Either a flowchart or narrative
- [x] Build the basic analysis and computation functions
    - [x] How hands will be evaluated and what will be returned
    - [x] Use the standard hand name conventions (pair, trips, full house, etc.)
    - [x] Straight
    - [x] Flush
    - [x] Full House
    - [X] Pair any card
    - [x] Straight Flush
    - [x] Quads
    - [x] Ask the user if they are facing an all in bet
        - [x] Add code to analysis to do the math. Should be different if they are facing a all in bet (meaning they won't just see the next card, they will see the next two cards)
    - [x] build function to get the target hand from the user
- ~~[ ] Flowchart/narrative for randomized boards and hands to test user~~
    - ~~[ ] Should only be for post-flop and the turn~~
    - Rational for removing this part of the program is in the ReadMe
- [x] Get a layout for how the board and flop/turn will be dispayed in the terminal
    - [x] layout how results will be displayed

## Sprint 3

- ~~[ ] If there is enough time, add the 4 and 2 method~~
- [x] Explain the program a little better in the readme
- [x] Restructure how the inputs are made by the user
- [x] Review program to identify improvements
- [x] Use roommate as free labor to test the program
- [x] Get powerpoint slide prepared and added to repository
- [x] Set up time to present project
