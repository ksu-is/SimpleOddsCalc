# Project Roadmap

## Sprint 1
- [x] Find related respository
    - https://github.com/ktseng/holdem_calc
- [x] Evaluate and run related program
    - Parts of holdem_calc  can be used, however due to errors in the code the program will not run. Will still examine the pieces identified as useful for reconstructing in this program
    - Useful areas of holdem_calc are the detecting named hands, user input, and evaluation of user input
    - May also want to add a GUI after program is functional. The calculator program we created will be useful for that
    - A lot of the programs found through github have issues, so remember not to be that guy who poorly documents and makes it hard for others to run your code
- [x] Find a readme example to use
    - Basic Structure is there, however continue to evaluate and add as needed
- [x] Update Readme file

## Sprint 2
- [ ] Get basic layout completed
    - [ ] Either a flowchart or narrative
- [ ] Build the basic analysis and computation functions
    - [ ] How hands will be evaluated and what will be returned
    - [ ] Use the standard hand name conventions (pair, trips, full house, etc.)
- [ ] Flowchart/narrative for randomized boards and hands to test user
    - [ ] Should only be for post-flop and the turn
- [ ] Get a layout for how the board and flop/turn will be dispayed in the terminal
    - [ ] layout how results will be displayed

## Sprint 3

- [ ] 1
- [ ] 2
