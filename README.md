# SimpleOddsCalc
=================

Program to teach how to do simple odds for Texas Hold-em.

I would like to write a program that trains people how to calculate the simple equity of a Texas holdem hand with a given board. With 2 people on this project, I think some more advanced calculations may be done, but I think I may be able to write this program for simple equity on my own. Equity in a poker hand is the percentage that you are likely to win a hand. There are complex calculators on the web currently that can give a person a very close approximation, but my program would help poker players learn how to do a quick calculation in their head. There would be two parts of the program, one would be for users to see two hole-cards and a board and input the simple equity into the program to see if they are right or wrong, and a second part where a user can enter two hole-cards and a board to see what the equity calculation would be. The first function of the program would be to test a user’s ability to calculate their simple equity. Users would be able to set how long they are given to calculate the percentage. Then, the user would be able to see the hand they are given and what cards are on the board. Once the user enters their guess for the percentage the program would tell them if they were right or wrong and display the correct percentage. The second function of the program would be to let the user input a two-card hand and enter the cards on the board (a 3 card “flop”, or the “flop” and the 1 “turn” card). This would be helpful to the user as they are able to check specific combinations instead of the randomly generated scenarios from the first function of the program. https://github.com/ksu-is/texas-holdem - I can reference this project for some of the logic and input from the user. https://github.com/ktseng/holdem_calc - This program goes a bit further with more complex calculations of odds, but may be useful and I can reference this program for harder but more accurate calculations.

As the project is completed, a write up of how the program functions will be put here.
